I've created three main scripts that together implement the complete VPN solution with privacy enhancements:

1. `setup-script.sh`: Main WireGuard installation and configuration
2. `monitoring-script.sh`: System monitoring and maintenance
3. `pre-encryption.sh`: Additional encryption layer (optional)

To use these scripts:

1. First, set up your AWS instance:
```bash
# Create t2.nano instance with Amazon Linux 2
# Configure security group:
# - UDP 51820 (WireGuard)
# - UDP 51821 (Pre-encryption, if using)
# - TCP 22 (SSH)
```

2. Copy the scripts to your server and make them executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup-script.sh
chmod +x monitoring-script.sh
chmod +x pre-encryption.sh
```

3. Run the basic setup:
```bash
./setup-script.sh
```

4. Start monitoring:
```bash
./monitoring-script.sh
```

5. Optionally, add pre-AWS encryption:
```bash
./pre-encryption.sh
```

The setup script will:
- Install all necessary packages
- Generate keys
- Configure WireGuard
- Create QR code for mobile client
- Start the service

The monitoring script provides:
- Interface status checking
- Resource monitoring
- Log viewing
- Traffic monitoring
- Connectivity testing

The pre-encryption script adds:
- SSL/TLS encryption layer
- Certificate generation
- Additional encrypted tunnel
- Automatic service management

Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail or create additional scripts for specific features?
